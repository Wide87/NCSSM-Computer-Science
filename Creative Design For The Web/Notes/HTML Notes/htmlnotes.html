                <h2>My favorite books</h2>
                <p>I am a frequent reader, and find myself reading a lot of Science/Young Adult Fiction recently. I wanted to make a list of all of those things, and put them in website form for this assignment.
                Most book series I have read I've liked, but some of them have really captivated my attention, and some of them make their way into my mind for weeks afterward, and change how I think about the world around me.
                One of my favorite authors recently has been Marie Lu, because her books have some way of engaging me so well that I've stayed up for hours just reading those books. Even the books I've read for some
                of my classes have been uncharacteristically good recently, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_(memoir)">Night,</a> by Elie Wiesel. Without any further ado, here are some of my favorite books I've read recently, in no particular order.
                </p>
                <h2>My Favorite Books of Late:</h2>
                <!--ul, meaning unordered list, basically a list with no index-->
                <ul>
                    <li>Steelstriker, Marie Lu</li>
                    <li>The fault in our Stars, John Green</li>
                    <li>20,000 Leagues under the Sea, Jules Verne</li>
                    <li>Eleanor and Park, Rainbow Rowell</li>
                    <li>Ender's Game, Orson Scott Card</li>
                    <li>Stars and Smoke, Marie Lu</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are definitely other books that I've read from before, but those are the ones in recent memory. I've thoroughly enjoyed every book I've read, and I believe that reading books is something that everyone
                    should do every once in a while. Anyway, that's enough from me. That's my favorite books recently, and that's my first actual website.
