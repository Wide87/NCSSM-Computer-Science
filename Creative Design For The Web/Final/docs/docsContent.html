                <p>This page is dedicated to publishing our team's practices and tips when it comes to coding, designing, and building robots. 
                    We want to share this knowledge with the rest of the robotics community, and we hope that this helps new teams out there.

                    <h2>Coding</h2>
                    <p>We are less experienced in coding and giving advice on it, as it is less explored in our area. 
                        We do use online resources to learn how to code properly, and all of those different resources are linked below.

                    <h2>Design</h2>
                    <p>Every team has design their robot before they build it, but something a lot of teams skip is just plotting out ideas on paper before jumping to CAD. 
                        CAD is a very nuanced subject, but as many teams do, we use Onshape for it's excellent suite of FRC tools, and it being free.</p>

                    <h2>Build</h2>
                    <p>Build is typically the most time-consuming part of FRC, especially for newer teams. Build encompasses manufacturing, assembly, and prototyping,
                        and is ultimately the product of your team. Below are some pages with tips for general build.</p>

                <p>As a newer team, we still have a lot to learn, but there are so many good resources out there for learning the nuances of FRC's many different facets.
                    We definitely have stronger areas than others, and documenting both our successes and failures makes it so what we learn isn't confined to just our team.
                    Learning and having fun are the two most important parts of FRC, and sharing our process helps other teams get farther.</p>
                <p>Here's a bunch of resources that we've found extremely helpful in our 7 years of being an FRC team.</p>
