                <p>"FIRST is more than robots. The robots are a vehicle for students to learn important life skills. Kids often come in not knowing what to expect - of the program nor of themselves. They leave, even after the first season, with a vision, with confidence, and with a sense that they can create their own future."</p>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Our mission as SMART, a FIRST robotics team, is to spark creativity and imagination in the students in our community.
                    We provide unique opportunities to students at our school, experiences that you can't get in many other places in our community.
                    Being from the rural mountains of North Carolina, there's less awareness of science and technology in our area. 
                    Our team visits local festivals and operates camps to teach upcoming highschoolers about lesser known opportunites that they can get involved in right now.
                    As a FIRST team, our mission is to positively impact our community and inspire new generations to get excited, not just in topics like those in STEAM, but in taking charge of themselves and learning new things.

                <h2>About the Team</h2>
                <p>SMART was started in 2018, with our first competitive season being Power Up. Since then, we've competed in every single year (except for 2020-21) with unique robots.
                    An aspect about our team we take pride in is that we strive to make unqiue robots each year. We try to make a different, wacky robot each year, one that innovates and stands out.
                    Our team spans about 15 members and two mentors, and we have Design, Build, Code, and PR teams that all accomplish unique tasks critical to our team's outreach and success at competition.

                <h2>Where is SMART?</h2>
                <p>Right now, we're in our off-season. Over the summer, we held two STEM camps: one at our high school for 9th-12th graders, and one at our nearby community college, SCC, for rising 5th-8th graders.
                    We're also recruiting for our upcoming 2025 FRC season.

                <h2>What do we do?</h2>
                <h3>In the Classroom</h3>
                <p>Through SMART, our team members build essential skills in engineering, entrepreneurship, and teamwork, and they do it in a fun and competitive environment.
                    Everyone on the team learns something about how to build, program, and market not just robots, but other things later in life.
                    We don't just meet to work on our robot and space, we meet to talk with friends, learn about STEM, build teamwork skills, and change our community for the better.
                </p>
                <h3>In the Community</h3>
                <p>We want to give back to the community as they have to us. We support our local FIRST teams in as many ways as we can.
                    From volunteering at tournaments for FIRST Competitions, to mentoring for FIRST Lego League and FIRST Lego League Explore teams.
                    We even bring our robot to local events around us, like our highschool's STEM Night, Southwestern Community College's STEM night, Greening up the Mountains, and Dillsboro's Lights and Luminaries.
                    Every time we attend a local even like that, our goal is to inspire young kids to not just join the team, but find a new passion for something they may not have heard before.
                </p>
                <h3>At the Competitions</h3>
                <p>We love going to competitions and meeting other teams in our area. We strive to make sure that everyone has a good competition day by talking to other teams and making sure they
                    know we're here to support and care for them. We also work together in our pit to make sure the robot works and can be put on the field quickly.
                    The competition environment can be stressful at times, but one of our biggest goals at competitions is to make sure that others enjoy their time there.
