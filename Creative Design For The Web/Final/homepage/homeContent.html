                <p>"FIRST is more than robots. The robots are a vehicle for students to learn important life skills. Kids often come in not knowing what to expect - of the program nor of themselves. They leave, even after the first season, with a vision, with confidence, and with a sense that they can create their own future."</p>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Our mission as SMART, a FIRST robotics team, is to spark creativity and imagination in the students in our community.
                    We provide unique opportunities to students at our school, experiences that you can't get in many other places in our community.
                    Being from the rural mountains of North Carolina, there's less awareness of science and technology in our area. 
                    Our team visits local festivals and operates camps to teach upcoming highschoolers about lesser known opportunites that they can get involved in right now.
                    As a FIRST team, our mission is to positively impact our community and inspire new generations to get excited, not just in topics like those in STEAM, but in taking charge of themselves and learning new things.

                <h2>About the Team</h2>
                <p>SMART was started in 2018, with our first competitive season being Power Up. Since then, we've competed in every single year (except for 2020-21) with unique robots.
                    An aspect about our team we take pride in is that we strive to make unqiue robots each year. We try to make a different, wacky robot each year, one that innovates and stands out.
                    Our team spans about 15 members and two mentors, and we have Design, Build, Code, and PR teams that all accomplish unique tasks critical to our team's outreach and success at competition.
