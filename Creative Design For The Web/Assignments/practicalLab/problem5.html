        <h1>Problem 5</h1>
        <h2>A Lovely Mosaic of Interlocking Parts</h2>
        <p>
            And now it's time to reveal a perplexing puzzle of prodigious proprtions. 
            This is a challenge that requires finesse and it's tantamount to sprinting 
            through gooey chewing gum. Be reminded that table header cells are yellow 
            and table datum cells are white. For your convenience, a style sheet is linked 
            in that makes the "tiles" a nice size.

        <!--align: center has been removed from here and put in the CSS file, as nu html checker gives an error for not
        css at this and that was part of the rubric. 
        If that's an issue, the line would have been written as <table align="center"-->
        <table>
            <!--First row. th goes to the next row, both tds stay on row 1.-->
