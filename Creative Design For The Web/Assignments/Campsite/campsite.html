            This was a pretty difficult project, mostly because I took it upon myself to use animations to make my cozy campsite. It was a fun challenge to try out though, and I learned a lot about CSS and HTML, as well as that
            using ASCII on websites is really hard. Overall, this was a really fun project to work on, and I love making ASCII art. I would like to talk about my inspiration for this project, though. A game that I beat a long time 
            ago that stuck with me is Outer Wilds, and these frames are inspired by the Dream World in that game, minus the impending fear that the inhabitants of that place put on you. I really love that game, and I wanted to make a  
            tribute for it in this assignment, because I saw a prime opportunity to do so.
