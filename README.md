Solutions to questions and assignments I had during my NCSSM Coding courses, Honors Introduction to Computer Science and Computational thinking, with Mr. Robinson, and AP Computer Science Principles, with ????

Not intended to be a cheatsheet, just a way for me to submit my assignments and show my work.

Most coding took place in April/May in CS and CT, with a lot of challenges.
