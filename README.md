Solutions to questions and assignments I had during my NCSSM Connect Course, Honors Introduction to Computer Science and Computational thinking, with Mr. Robinson.

Not intended to be a cheatsheet, just a way for me to submit my assignments and show my work.
All was coded using GitHub codespaces, and pushed to the main branch on repo, in case any other newbies want to replicate the sweet setup I had for this class.
Most coding took place in April/May, with a lot of challenges. I also partook in some PyGame shenanigans, but that never went anywhere unforntunately, but I resolve to do it one day.
