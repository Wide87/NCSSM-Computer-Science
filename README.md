# NCSSM Computer Science Repo

#### Solutions to questions and assignments I had during my NCSSM Coding courses, Honors Introduction to Computer Science and Computational thinking with Mr. Robinson, Honors Creative Design for the Web with Mr. Robinson.

#### Not intended to be a cheatsheet, just a way for me to submit my assignments and show my work.
#### All was coded using GitHub codespaces in case any other newbies want to replicate the setup I had for these classes.
